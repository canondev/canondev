## üôç About me

I am Miko≈Çaj and I am 20 years old. I mainly design and develop websites based on the popular CMS WordPress, online stores based on WooCommerce or Shoper. Recently, he is also working on projects based on the PHP framework - Laravel.

I create projects not only according to rigidly adopted rules, but I can also offer other more interesting alternatives for the client. My projects are varied and so are the needs of the people who order the projects. I am a diligent, accurate and timely person. Everything is in order in my source code.
